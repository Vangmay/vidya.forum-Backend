### Improvements required

- Sending a delete request while not logged in leads to
  "panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference"

- The email and username are all case-sensitive, this can be a problem

- Another user is able to delete a post

### Good stuff

- Authentication works well 👍
